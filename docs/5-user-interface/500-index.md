User Interface
===================

As well as the web service which exposes the REST API, MagiQL provides an optional user interface which can be installed seperately.

The Data Exporer UI allows you to quickly build up queries by selecting columns, filters, sorting and summarizing and then execute and display the queries. The UI is expecially useful for development and ad hoc querying to explore and retrieve data. In addition to displaying tablular data results, the Data Explorer UI allows you to export all matching data from a query to a spreadsheet.

The Data Explorer UI includes a Column Manager section to easily view, update and create columns.

The Data Explorer can be installed as is, or customised by cloning and editing the source code.
