Column Metadata
===
 
Column Metadata allows you to store additional key-value information against individual columns. This metadata can be used by the built in [render filters](/docs/extensibility/render-filters/), but can also be consumed by your own application for other purposes.

Column metadata is returned in the [GET selectable columns](/docs/api/columns/#get-selectable-columns) api call.
